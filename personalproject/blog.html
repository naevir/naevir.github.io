            <h2>Blue Yeti's <i>Yeticaster</i></h2>
            <h3>June 9, 2020</h3>
            <h5>Boom Arm Problem, Image from "Blue Designs"</h5>
            <img src="blog/blueyeti.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">
            <p>So I own a Blue Yeti Microphone, specifically the Blackout Edition. And along with the microphone I have the Yeticaster: <i>Blue's</i> own boom arm, shock mount, and microphone bundle for a low price of $199.99. I have owned the  Yeticaster for awhile now, and it worked fine...well not really. The problem started with my missing bolt that attaches the Yeti to the shock mount. Since I couldn't find the original one, I had to buy one. The ones on Amazon were ridiculously overpriced (at a whopping $9 for a single bolt), so I opted to find one at Lowe's. I was able to find one but it was pretty long, so I also bought a hex nut to choose where to stop the bolt--this made the setup pretty heavy.</p>

            <p>My DIY fix solved the main problem. But not much later the next problem appeared. This was that my desk's edges are curved so the clasp that'd normally attach to the side of your desk had to be placed elsewhere. Luckily, I was able to place it on my nearby bookshelf. However, over time the arm started to sag because of the combined weight of Yeti and bolt and hex nut. So I decided to watch a youtube video and discovered that the boom arm was configurable via the bottom screw. There ran a tube throughout the boom arm that could be adjusted via that screw. This fixed my problem, along with me switching the microphone from facing downwards to upwards on the shock mount. This also helped fix my balance problem. Annnd voila, the Yeti setup is complete and perfect!</p>

            <h2>Gaming/Content Creation Setup</h2>
            <h3>June 2, 2020</h3>
            <h5>Upgrading my Setup, Image from Reddit r/battlestations</h5>
            <img src="blog/setup.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">
            <p>With this whole quarantine business, I have been spending a lot more time on my gaming setup, maybe a little too much but I digress. With the increased usage of my PC, I decided I might as well make it look more aesthetic as well as do some upgrades. My current setup is more than powerful for what I normally do, Windows browsing, YouTube, Photoshop, and Gaming. However, the recent craze for the new Call of Duty Battle Royale (Warzone) that has been released, that mixed with the increased amount of time I spend on my computer has concocted a new inspiration.</p>
            <p>This inspired me to get back into FPS (First Person Shooter) games and improve my setup so that it is easier to do so. I first bought a 144hz monitor because I honestly think that this would be a major quality of life improvement as well as make my gaming experience better. But that was not the only thing I considered; it is said that higher refresh rate monitors lessen eyestrain because there is less screen tearing. In addition, the ViewSonic 24" Curved Gaming Monitor 144Hz Full HD Resolution is <i>curved</i>. Studies have also shown that a more rounded viewing angle distributes the information your eye receives much more evenly, resulting in a better experience overall.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I bought a new mousepad and gaming mouse to improve my overall aim and tracking. The mousepad I got was a generic extended one from Amazon with a 4.8/5 rating; I would say it’s well worth the $15. The mouse is a little more special, the Glorious Model O- weighing around 58 grams, it’s incredibly light especially compared to my Razer Deathadder Chroma’s 105 grams of weight. Not to mention that it’s white with a design similar to the notorious Finalmouse hexagon pattern. This mouse will compliment my set up black, blue, and white nicely. </p>
