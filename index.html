<h1 style=color:#ff9900;background-color:#d1e0e0>Welcome to Phillip's Page!</h1>
<p>Hi There! This is will be your window into my Spring quarter!</p>

<div>
    <h2 style=color:#ff9900>Introductions!</h2>  
        <p>Unfortunately I cannot play any instruments unlike my lovely team 4 mates! But I guarantee my page will nevertheless be interesting!<br>
        I'd like to share a little of what I've been doing <span style="color:#006622"><em>quarantining</em></span> while working on schoolwork!</p>

    <h2 style=color:#ff9900>What I've been up to!</h2>
        <table>
                <tr>
                  <th><strong>Video Games</strong></th>
                  <th><strong>Music</strong></th>
                  <th><strong>TV Shows/Anime</strong></th>
                </tr>
        </table>
    <h2 style=color:#ff9900>More information!</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Modern Warfare Warzone</strong> - The rush of a Battle Royale victory with friends is unbeatable!</p> </li>
            <li><p><strong>Gimme Love by Joji</strong> - Joji's blend of r&b and lo-fi is very satisfying and I've been enjoying his latest single.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Crash Landing on You and One Piece</strong> - I'm actually watching these two shows with friends! The KDrama with my girlfriend, and One Piece with my best friend.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 style=color:#ff9900>Interesting Trend</h2> 
        <p><strong>I've recently noticed a trend of people posting Bill Clinton sitting by a hand rail with their top 4 albums and friend nominations.<br> 
        I was recently nominated so I thought it'd be cool to try it out.</strong></p>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/Clinton_Swag/yGafCxn8C0/swag.png" alt="Phillip's Bill Clinton Swag Top 4 Albums">  
        <p><strong>I'd probably rank these albums as...</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Starboy</li>  
            <li>Astroworld</li>  
            <li>HER</li>  
            <li>Northsbest</li>  
        </ol>
    <h2 style=color:#ff9900>Thanks for tuning in!</h2>
